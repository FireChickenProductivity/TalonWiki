# Operators

With supported languages, most operators can be dictated with `op (operator name)` and comparison operators can be dictated with `is (operator name)`.

For example, saying `op equal` in python will type `=`. Saying `is equal` in python will type `==`.

You can find the spoken forms for the operators in the talon-list files with names that start with `operators` in the [lang/tags directory](https://github.com/talonhub/community/tree/main/lang/tags).

To see which operators are supported for a given language or change how any operators are inserted, find the python file for the language implementation in the [lang directory](https://github.com/talonhub/community/tree/main/lang) and look for the defined Operators object.
