# Voice Coding Overview

Talon community offers commands for inserting code in numerous languages. [Formatters](formatters.md) make dictating formatted variable names easier. [Operator commands](operators.md) support dictating things like variable assignment, mathematical operators, and comparison operators. [Snippets](snippets.md) allow efficiently dictating formulaic code patterns and are used for things like control flow statements, class definitions, return statements and more. [Additional commands](language-specific.md) exist on a per language basis to make common tasks easier.

[Cursorless](https://www.cursorless.org/docs/user/installation/) offers the state of the art approach to editing code by voice.
